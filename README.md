# CZ2001-Algorithms-Projects
This repository contains projects completed under the "Algorithms" module at NTU Singapore. It contains implementations and complexity analysis' of STRING and GRAPH search algorithms. We also compare and contrast these new algorithms to our implementations of existing state-of-the-art search algorithms.
